          As hybrid work reshapes how we use office spaces, commercial interior design is undergoing a transformation.
          In 2025, workspaces are not just about functionality — they’re about wellbeing, technology, brand identity,
          and sustainability. Here are the top 7 trends redefining modern commercial interiors this year.
        </p>

        <img src="/blog1img1.webp" alt="Interior img" />

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">
          1. Biophilic Design: Nature Meets Functionality
        </h2>
        <p>
          Biophilic design—integrating natural elements like plants, sunlight, and organic textures—is now a must-have in
          office environments. Research from Harvard Health shows it boosts employee productivity and reduces stress.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Indoor trees and moss walls</li>
          <li>Skylights and glass facades for natural light</li>
          <li>Water elements like fountains or aquariums</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">
          2. Smart Workspaces Powered by Technology
        </h2>
        <p>
          The rise of AI-powered lighting, occupancy sensors, and smart HVAC systems is reshaping how we interact with
          office space. Reports from Gartner predict smart offices will increase by 43% globally by 2026.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">

          3. Flexible Layouts for Hybrid Work
        </h2>
        <p>
          With hot-desking, moveable furniture, and modular design, flexibility is critical in 2025. It supports both
          remote and in-office teams in a single ecosystem.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">
          4. Branding Through Interior Identity
        </h2>
        <p>
          From logo walls to color-themed zones, branding has entered the design language of interiors. According to
          Forbes, brand-focused design can improve employee retention by creating a stronger identity.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Branded wall murals and taglines</li>
          <li>Strategic color psychology in meeting rooms</li>

          5. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Materials
        </h2>
        <p>
          Offices are increasingly using bamboo flooring, recycled metal, reclaimed wood, and VOC-free paints. The USGBC’s
          LEED program and WELL Certification are guiding green workspace design.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Bamboo or cork flooring</li>
          <li>Upcycled or reclaimed furniture</li>

        </h2>
        <p>
          Height-adjustable desks, daylight simulation, quiet zones, and air purification systems are integrated to
          support employee well-being. McKinsey research shows wellness-focused workspaces can increase productivity by
          up to 25%.
